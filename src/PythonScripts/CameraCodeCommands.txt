From Terminal:

Take a picture: sudo raspistill -o filename.jpg -t (amt. of time delay in seconds) x 1000
Still video feed: sudo raspistill -p -o -t (amt. of time delay in seconds) x 1000 -> Select 0 for time delay to take infinite preview

From Python: 

Still Video feed:

import picamera
import time

camera = picamera.PiCamera()
camera.start_preview()
time.sleep(preview time in seconds)
camera.stop_preview()

Take a picture:

import picamera
import time

camera = picamera.PiCamera()
camera.capture(filename.jpg)

Sorry, just realized you shouldn't need to import time for taking a picture in python
